# Sibi Engineer Test
The purpose of this is to verify you have familiarity with our stack and are able to work with it.
Stack: Node, Express, React, & Postgres

# Provided resources
Contact list csv file
Company logo

# Requirements
We need you to setup and create 2 applications that talk with a central DB.  It is to be hosted on Heroku and you can use the free hobby license to do so.  You will host a postgresql DB on Heroku(free) that will talk with your applications.  All code should be stored in a git repo you can provide us access to.

# DB
Import the provided csv file into the DB and specify column attributes as you deem fit.
* Application 1
  * This will reside on its own separate node in Heroku.  It presents the user with a form that accepts contact info that upon submission is added to the database.
* Application 2
  * This will reside on its own separate node in Heroku.  It will be a list view of records with a search function.  The records are pulled from the DB you setup.  It should allow search by first or last name to find a desired record.  If the user clicks on a record display a more detailed view of that record.

Please identify any additions you make beyond the initial spec and reasoning for doing so.
Please track amount of time spent on this exercise.
